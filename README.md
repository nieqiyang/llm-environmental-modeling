## 🛠 Prerequisites & Guidance

### 1. RRI Model
The target environmental model used in this study is the **RRI (Rainfall-Runoff-Inundation) Model**. 
* For the RRI model executable, official documentation, and operation instructions, please visit the [ICHARM official website](https://www.pwri.go.jp/icharm/research/rri/rri_top.html).

### 2. LLM Prompts
Detailed information regarding the **LLM Prompts** (system instructions, few-shot examples, etc.) used in this study can be found in the **Supporting Information (SI)** of the research paper.
